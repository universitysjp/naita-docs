# NAITA internship diary

A Bun CLI and OpenTUI terminal interface for filling the supplied `docs/daily-diary-template.pdf`. The diary is saved week by week so you can come back to any step, add information later, or edit the files yourself. All student data lives in one Git-ignored `local/` folder inside the workspace: profile, cached Git history, weekly notes, screenshots, change history, and generated PDFs.

Each week contains short bullet points for:

- Work carried out
- Problems encountered
- How they were solved
- Learning
- Improvements for next week

Screenshots follow the written notes for that week. Git history provides dated evidence and suggested work descriptions. Questions about problems, solutions, and learning help you add your own experience. Suggestions remain separate from your diary until you accept them.

## Install and start

Requirements: Bun 1.3+, Git, and Times New Roman. The CLI, TUI, and application code run on Bun with TypeScript; Vitest and Playwright provide the test runners.

```sh
bun install
bun run start
```

The terminal menu lets you edit a profile field, open any week, import Git history, confirm attendance, review suggestions, manage screenshot captions, or export a PDF. Use Up/Down and Enter to choose, Escape to go back, and Ctrl+C to exit. Saved entries remain available next time. Returning to attendance prefills the saved dates; clearing a field explicitly records no dates for that category.

Times New Roman is detected on Windows, macOS, and common Linux Microsoft-font installations. If needed, use `generate --font /path/to/times.ttf` or set `NAITA_TIMES_FONT`. The font must be Times New Roman; it is embedded in the PDF. No Windows-only path is required.

## Work through the CLI in any order

```sh
bun run cli -- help
bun run cli -- status
```

Every command supports `--workspace PATH` and `--json`. The workspace defaults to your current directory; the bundled template is located relative to the program. For example, `--workspace C:\diaries\student` stores files under `C:\diaries\student\local`. Pass the parent workspace, not its `local` folder. The CLI does not require the OpenTUI runtime. `naita-diary` points to the scripted CLI; `bun run start` opens the terminal menu.

Fill the profile interactively, import JSON, or set one field at a time:

```sh
bun run cli -- init
bun run cli -- init --from docs/examples/profile.json
bun run cli -- profile --field name --text "Your name"
bun run cli -- profile --field trainingStart --text "2026-04-06"
bun run cli -- profile --field trainingEnd --text "2026-04-17"
bun run cli -- weeks
```

`docs/examples/profile.json` contains fictional sample information. Replace it with your own information. Training start/end dates are needed to create week files; other profile fields can be completed later. Name and establishment are also required for PDF export. Status lists every unfilled profile field, distinguishing required fields from optional ones. `init` creates all week files and empty screenshot folders as soon as both training dates are set. Completing those dates through `profile` also creates them. Re-running initialization keeps existing notes and screenshots.

Read one or more local repositories, including repositories outside this project:

```sh
bun run cli -- import --repo ../student-project --author "you@example.com"
bun run cli -- import --repo ../frontend --repo ../backend --author "you@example.com"
```

Use `--author` in a shared repository so other contributors' commits are not attributed to you. Without it, all authors are included. Re-running `import` without `--repo` refreshes all previously saved repositories. Supplying `--repo` adds or refreshes those sources while retaining cached evidence from the others. To change the author filter, refresh all saved sources together. Re-importing preserves accepted points and manual edits. Git reads all branches, excludes merges, deduplicates identical hashes across repositories, and retains subjects, bodies, authors, and full hashes.

The first import persists this evidence in `local/state.json`. Later `show`, `context`, `draft`, and `generate` commands reuse it without reading Git again; they work even when the original repositories are unavailable. Use `import` explicitly when you want new commits (or pass `generate --repo PATH`). Refreshing a source updates its current evidence, including removal of commits no longer in its history; previous imports remain available in the change log.

Dates use the author's calendar date in the commit's recorded timezone. Filtering does not use Git's committer-date `--since`, so rebasing work later does not remove it from the original training week. No Git repository is modified or checked out.

Confirm attendance, even when there are no absences:

```sh
bun run cli -- absence --leave "2026-04-10" --medical ""
bun run cli -- absence --off "2026-04-13..2026-04-14"
```

Dates can be comma-separated or inclusive `START..END` ranges. Each supplied option replaces that category; omitted categories keep their saved dates. The CLI rejects invalid dates, overlaps, and dates outside the training period. Outside-period dates stay empty; leave and medical dates take precedence over Git work. Attendance conflicts are shown in status and block a completed export.

The default schedule is Monday-Friday. Weekend commits count as work unless an explicit absence/non-working date applies. Set `workingDays` in the profile JSON to change the regular schedule (Sunday is 0, Saturday is 6). A scheduled work day without commits or manual notes stays unfinished; the tool does not invent work.

## Write and revise a week

```sh
bun run cli -- draft --week 1
bun run cli -- show --week 1
bun run cli -- accept --week 1 --accept-drafts
bun run cli -- accept --week 1 --id SUGGESTION_ID --text "The list stayed blank after I cleared the search."
bun run cli -- dismiss --week 1 --id SUGGESTION_ID
```

`draft` makes concise work proposals from commits and specific questions for the remaining weekly sections. `--accept-drafts` accepts factual work proposals only; experience questions still need your answer. An accepted or dismissed suggestion does not reappear on the next draft. The student is responsible for checking that the proposed wording accurately describes their work.

Add an extra point, insert it before another point, or correct existing wording:

```sh
bun run cli -- add --week 1 --section learning --text "Learned why clearing a search should restore the full list."
bun run cli -- add --week 1 --section work --before POINT_ID --text "Reviewed feedback on the search box."
bun run cli -- edit --week 1 --section work --id POINT_ID --text "Added a task-title search box."
bun run cli -- edit --week 1 --section work --id POINT_ID --remove
bun run cli -- add --week 1 --date 2026-04-08 --text "Set up the local development environment."
```

Sections are `work`, `problems`, `solutions`, `learning`, and `improvements`. Use a week number or its Monday date. `show` includes point and suggestion IDs. Weekly points describe the whole week. Daily points belong to the date table. The first manual daily addition copies the Git descriptions into editable points before appending the new note. That customized daily list then takes precedence over automatic Git descriptions, so subsequent imports cannot replace your edits.

Write naturally: "Fixed the empty search state and checked that clearing the input restored the list." Keep the technical detail that explains what you did; avoid inflated claims. If there were no problems, write that explicitly. A proposed improvement for next week should not read as completed work.

## Checklist: write first, screenshots last

```sh
bun run cli -- checklist
bun run cli -- checklist --week 2
bun run cli -- checklist --week 2 --json
```

`init` saves a checklist under `local/`. After reading Git history, `import` prints an updated task list and screenshot plan. The OpenTUI home menu includes **Checklist and screenshot plan**; each week's screenshot menu also has **What screenshots should I add?**

Work through the profile, attendance, Git import and written notes first. Then use the checklist to collect real screenshots as the last content step, followed by reviewing each week and exporting the completed PDF. Missing images never block writing, importing evidence, or generating a draft.

Each week lists its dates, outstanding tasks, exact screenshot destination folder, optional filenames, and ideas for what to capture. For example, a search commit suggests showing the input and resulting list; an API commit suggests a request and response; a test commit suggests the command and actual test output. Ideas cite the cached commits and source repository paths. Student-supplied work notes also get ideas, including activities with no Git commit. Commits on leave, medical, or other non-working dates do not become capture suggestions.

These are rule-based suggestions from Git messages and saved notes, not verified screens, test results, or instructions to reproduce old work. Choose representative images; one per commit is not required. Verify that the image matches the actual week and activity, and redact secrets/private data. When no visual evidence is suitable, supply a reason through `screenshots --week NUMBER --reason TEXT`.

`local/CHECKLIST.md` is the readable report; `local/checklist.json` contains the same structured tasks and capture ideas for agents. Normal commands refresh both from saved data, including screenshots you add later; no AI or fresh Git read is needed. `--week` filters the CLI view but leaves the saved whole-diary checklist intact. Dry runs, `help`, and `agent-guide` do not rewrite reports.

The reports are generated, so do not manually tick or edit them: change the diary notes, attendance, images or captions instead. Task ticks reflect saved content; image presence does not verify what an image depicts. Derived reports are not recorded as student edits in the history log. The final export task is complete only after a completed PDF export, and becomes pending again after diary changes.

## Screenshot folders and manual editing

`init` (once training dates are provided) creates this structure. `weeks` can also ensure the folders exist or show their full paths:

```text
local/
  .gitignore                           # ignores everything in this folder
  profile.json                         # student and training details
  state.json                           # cached commits, repositories, attendance
  CHECKLIST.md                         # readable task list and weekly capture guide
  checklist.json                       # same live checklist for CLI/agents
  weeks/
    week-01-2026-04-06.json
    week-02-2026-04-13.json
  screenshots/
    week-01-2026-04-06/
      01-task-list.png
      02-search-result.jpg
    week-02-2026-04-13/
  history/
    changes.jsonl                      # timestamped before/after change records
  output/
    NAITA-Daily-Diary.pdf               # created by generate
```

Put screenshots of your work in the matching folder. PNG, JPG, and JPEG files are detected each time you run status or export, sorted by filename with numeric ordering, and scaled proportionally. Images are not stretched or cropped. Invalid images are reported and block PDF generation; unsupported files are listed by status. Use images no larger than 25 MB each.

```sh
bun run cli -- screenshots --week 1
bun run cli -- screenshots --week 1 --file 01-task-list.png --text "The task list after adding title search."
bun run cli -- screenshots --week 2 --reason "This week involved reading documentation; no visual work to show."
```

An empty screenshot folder remains unfinished unless you give a reason. Pass `--reason ""` to clear the exemption. Captions default to readable filenames.

You can edit the weekly JSON directly. Keep the week number, dates, IDs, arrays, and schema fields intact; change point text or add a point with a unique ID, `text`, `source: "manual"`, and `evidence: []`. Commands validate and reread the files. Malformed files produce an error instead of being silently replaced. Changing training dates after weeks exist is blocked to avoid losing entries; use a different workspace for another training period.

The entire `local/` folder is ignored by Git, including in an external workspace. Back up or copy the whole folder to keep the diary and its history together.

Older workspaces using `naita-diary.json`, `diary/`, and `output/` are copied into `local/` on the next normal command. The old files remain as a backup; subsequent commands use only `local/`. Dry runs can read the old structure without copying it. Existing `local/` data is never replaced by another migration.

## Log manual and AI-assisted changes

Use `add --before POINT_ID` to insert a student-supplied activity between existing points, even when it has no Git commit. It is saved with `source: "manual"` and empty commit evidence. `edit` changes or removes an individual point; imports and AI drafts preserve its placement and wording.

```sh
bun run cli -- show --week 1 --json
bun run cli -- add --week 1 --section work --before POINT_ID --text "Discussed the search design with my supervisor." --actor codex --reason "Activity supplied by the student."
bun run cli -- history --week 1 --json
```

`local/history/changes.jsonl` is append-only JSON Lines: each event records its time, command, optional actor/reason, and changed files with their previous and new values. Full JSON values preserve point IDs, sources, ordering, removals, accepted/dismissed proposals, attendance, and cached Git evidence. Actor labels are caller-supplied, not proof of identity. Exports record their path/page count; screenshot changes record names, hashes and sizes, not duplicate image bytes.

Direct JSON edits are detected as `external-edit` on the next command, including `status`, `show`, or `history`. These are observed changes, not a live editor log: multiple saves between commands appear as one change, timestamped when observed. Read-only dry runs, `help`, and `agent-guide` never checkpoint or migrate files. The journal preserves earlier text, but does not itself replay changes into the current diary; use the CLI to restore a point after inspecting its history.

## Progress and PDF export

```sh
bun run cli -- status
bun run cli -- status --week 1 --json
bun run cli -- review --week 1
bun run cli -- generate
bun run cli -- generate --strict --out local/output/completed-diary.pdf
bun run cli -- generate --repo ../student-project --dry-run
```

Status shows section point counts, unfilled work dates, screenshot counts/errors, pending suggestions, and review state for each week. The percentage measures filled sections, work dates, and the screenshot step. A week is ready only when those are filled, absences are confirmed, suggestions and attendance conflicts are resolved, required profile fields exist, and the week has been reviewed. Editing notes, attendance, profile data, Git evidence, captions, or screenshot contents invalidates the affected review. PDF export defaults to `local/output/NAITA-Daily-Diary.pdf`; `--out` overrides that location.

Draft exports can contain unfinished areas, visibly marked "Not filled in yet." Unaccepted suggestions never enter the PDF. Leave and medical dates must be confirmed before any PDF export. Non-interactive commands fail with instructions instead of hanging at a prompt. `--dry-run` returns the calendar and evidence as JSON without writing profile, week, screenshot, or PDF files.

The supplied PDF is a static eight-page A4 document with no AcroForm fields. Its pages remain the background. The output contains the cover and filled profile, then a daily table, weekly bullet notes, and screenshot/continuation sheets for each week. Notes flow onto additional template pages when necessary; long daily entries continue in the weekly notes instead of being cut off. The last screenshot uses the shorter continuation sheet above its signature and certification area. Trainee signatures, engineer certification, inspection pages, supervisor reports, and official leave counts are left for their intended signatories. The original template is never overwritten.

## AI-assisted wording

```sh
bun run cli -- agent-guide
bun run cli -- context --week 1 --prompt
bun run cli -- draft --week 1 --agent codex
bun run cli -- draft --week 1 --agent claude
bun run cli -- draft --week 1 --from local/agent-response.json
```

See [the agent workflow](docs/AI-WORKFLOW.md) for the JSON contract and instructions for using the CLI. Agents should inspect status/context and use small CLI edits. They receive only weekly evidence and existing notes, and return proposals for review. They do not control attendance or PDF coordinates. Full same-week commit references are validated, but the student still checks the meaning of a proposal. No paid agent is required for the normal workflow or automated tests.

## Tests

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bunx playwright install chromium
bun run test
bun run test:tui
bun run test:e2e
bun run typecheck
# Or run all checks:
bun run test:all
```

Oxfmt formats the project and Oxlint checks it:

```sh
bun run format
bun run format:check
bun run lint
```

Bun executes the complete application directly with `bun run cli:bun`. The TypeScript runner supports `.ts` and `.mts`, and subprocess work uses Bun's `Bun.spawn`/`Bun.spawnSync` APIs. Vitest's Node workers use a narrow compatibility fallback for unit imports, while integration and browser subprocesses invoke the Bun CLI. Filesystem operations use Bun-compatible `node:fs` APIs, which Bun documents as supported. The OpenTUI entry point is TypeScript and runs on Bun.

Vitest is pinned to **5.0.0**. Tests use isolated temporary workspaces and Git repositories outside those workspaces. PDF tests use the actual supplied template, verify the text and its bounds, exercise overflow and image embedding, and check that original/official pages remain unchanged. They need Times New Roman locally or through `NAITA_TIMES_FONT`.

OpenTUI's native tests run with Bun, using its documented in-memory renderer and real keyboard events. Playwright runs the CLI from profile/evidence through a completed export, then renders the PDF in Chromium through a local PDF.js test viewer. It checks weekly separation, manual edits, image detection, text bounds, and PNG/JPEG rendering. The viewer is test infrastructure, not a new application. Browser artifacts and the sample test PDF are in `output/playwright/`. Sample content and screenshots are explicitly test fixtures, not a real student diary.
