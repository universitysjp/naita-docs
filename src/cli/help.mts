export const HELP = `NAITA internship diary

Usage: bun run cli -- COMMAND [options]
Every command supports --workspace PATH (default: current directory) and --json.
Student files and default PDFs live under WORKSPACE/local/ (ignored by Git).
Use --actor NAME and --reason TEXT to annotate a change in the local history.
Run bun run start for the terminal menu. Steps can be revisited independently.

  export                                 Alias for generate
  report [--out FILE.pdf] [--logo FILE] [--font times.ttf]
                                         Generate the report from diary data and screenshots
  stamp [--report FILE.pdf] [--report-pages last]
        [--diary FILE.pdf] [--diary-pages second,penultimate]
        [--out FILE.pdf]                Collect the pages that need a rubber stamp

Sections: work, problems, solutions, learning, improvements.
Dates: YYYY-MM-DD, comma-separated or inclusive START..END ranges.
Default work schedule: Monday-Friday; weekend commits count as work.
--strict requires filled sections/days, screenshots or a reason, no pending
suggestions/attendance conflicts, confirmed absences, and a current review.
Unaccepted suggestions never appear in the PDF. Manual week JSON edits are read
on every command. Re-importing or re-drafting never replaces accepted points.
Draft/context/generate reuse local/state.json without accessing source repos.
Run import to refresh all saved repos, or --repo PATH to refresh/add selected ones.
Default PDF: local/output/NAITA-Daily-Diary.pdf. Direct file edits are logged on
the next command; help, agent-guide, and generate --dry-run do not write logs.
Init/import and normal commands refresh local/CHECKLIST.md and checklist.json.
Import also prints the checklist. Write notes first; add screenshots last, then
review/export. Capture ideas are optional, not proof of a screen or test result.
stamp builds one small PDF from the pages that carry a signature, certification,
or supervisor block, so a supervisor can be handed a few pages instead of the
whole document. Page names: first, second, penultimate, last, or a page number.
stamp needs the documents to exist already; generate or report them first.
Report PDF: local/report/output/NAITA-Industrial-Training-Report-draft.pdf.
Report generation preserves missing academic and company facts as placeholders
and reports the remaining inputs in the CLI result.
